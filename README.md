HydroCode
=========

Code for calculating atmospheric stream functions. 
Meridional overturning, zonal overturning, barotropic, hydrothermal. 

Adopts the generalised vertical coordinate method of Doos & Nilsson (JAS, 2011), and the thermodynamic stream functions of Nycander (JPO, 2007) and Kjellsson et al. (JAS, 2013). 

Supported data is ERA-Interim and various CMIP5 models, all using model (hybrid) vertical levels.

The program is written in Fortran 95 with OpenMP shared-memory parallellisation.
